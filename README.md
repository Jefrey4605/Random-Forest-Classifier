# RoadMine_XGBRegressor

Classified by ***Jefrey Jose D***

This repository is one of my first ML applications using Kaggle. The Dataset was given by the MIC-VITC personnel for the recruitment process, which I've used after the recruitment process has concluded.
We analyse different data models to find which best suits our data, initially tried only with **random-forests** which yielded a result of **65%**, but the **XGB Regressor** yields a result of **67%**.

It would be important to take into account that the best accuracy on the MIC leaderboard was **72%**.
